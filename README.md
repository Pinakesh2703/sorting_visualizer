Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This interactive tool is designed to help you understand and visualize common sorting algorithms. Whether you're a student learning about algorithms for the first time, a developer refreshing your knowledge, or simply curious about how computers organize data, this visualizer offers a clear and engaging way to explore sorting methods.

Features:
- Multiple Algorithms: Visualize Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- Real-time Visualization: Watch as the algorithms rearrange the data, with active elements highlighted for clarity.
- Interactive Controls: Start, pause, and reset the sorting process at any time.
- Educational Descriptions: Learn about each algorithm with concise explanations below the visualizer.

To get started, simply choose an algorithm from the control panel and click its button. The visualization will begin immediately, allowing you to observe how each method approaches the task of sorting.

This tool is perfect for:
- Students studying computer science or data structures and algorithms
- Teachers looking for a visual aid in their lessons
- Developers preparing for technical interviews
- Anyone interested in the fascinating world of algorithmic problem-solving

The visualizer uses an array of 15 elements, represented as vertical bars of varying heights. The height of each bar corresponds to its value in the array. As the sorting algorithm progresses, you'll see these bars rearrange themselves, with the active elements highlighted in red to show which parts of the array are being compared or swapped at each step.

Each algorithm comes with its own unique characteristics:

1. Bubble Sort: Watch as larger elements "bubble up" to their correct positions.
2. Selection Sort: Observe how the algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion.
3. Insertion Sort: See how each element is inserted into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.
4. Merge Sort: Witness the divide-and-conquer approach as the array is split, sorted, and merged.
5. Quick Sort: Experience the efficiency of partitioning around a pivot element.

Dive in and explore the inner workings of these fundamental sorting algorithms. By visualizing these processes, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how computers organize and manipulate data. Happy learning!
